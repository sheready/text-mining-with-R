#The %/% operator does integer division (x %/% y is equivalent to floor(x/y)) so the index keeps track of which 80-line section of text we are counting up negative and positive sentiment in.
#We then use spread() so that we have negative and positive sentiment in separate columns, and lastly calculate a net sentiment (positive - negative).

#The three different lexicons for calculating sentiment give results that are different in an absolute sense but have similar relative trajectories through the novel. 
#Coclusion:We see similar dips and peaks in sentiment at about the same places in the novel, but the absolute values are significantly different. The AFINN lexicon gives the largest absolute values, with high positive values. The lexicon from Bing et al. has lower absolute values and seems to label larger blocks of contiguous positive or negative text. The NRC results are shifted higher relative to the other two, labeling the text more positively, but detects similar relative changes in the text. We find similar differences between the methods when looking at other novels; the NRC sentiment is high, the AFINN sentiment has more variance, the Bing et al. sentiment appears to find longer stretches of similar text, but all three agree roughly on the overall trends in the sentiment through a narrative arc.
#Why is, for example, the result for the NRC lexicon biased so high in sentiment compared to the Bing et al. result? Let’s look briefly at how many positive and negative words are in these lexicons.

#Looking at units beyond just words.

#R packages included coreNLP (T. Arnold and Tilton 2016), cleanNLP (T. B. Arnold 2016), and sentimentr (Rinker 2017) are examples of such sentiment analysis algorithms.
